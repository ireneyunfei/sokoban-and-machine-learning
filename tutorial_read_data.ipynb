    "\n",
    "These documents introduces the detailed procedures of using machine learning techniques to analyze the logfiles of sokoban. Here is the first part, reading data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Languages used include Python (3.0+) and R. I recommend you install [anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), a data science platform including all the tools and packages we need.\n",
    "\n",
    "To write code in Python, the IDE Spyder is highly recommended. It provides a matlab-like interface, and also interactive programming experience, which is very handy in data analysis. Meanwhile, Pycharm, Visual Studio Code and sublime text are also very good IDEs.\n",
    "\n",
    "For R, RStudio is the most renowned IDE. There is no better choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is written in Jupyter Notebook, which allows the combination of documents and live codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "All these tools can be installed by anaconda.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may want to read tutorials for R and Python [here](). Besides the basics syntax of languages, you are also encouraged (or even required) to read documentations for packages such as scikit-learning in Python and data.table in R."
