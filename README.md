# sokoban-and-machine-learning

This project is my undergraduate thesis. I implemented Machine Learning in the analysis of the logfile of the game Sokoban and use it
to predict one's math grades and Raven intelligence.

The codes are divided into three parts: reading the data, cleaning the data, and finally training the model. In addition, I also provide 
an appendix to solve the Sokoban model, which is based on code published on the internet (I'm sorry, I forget the source).

The first and the last part is written in Python (those ends with .ipynb). You can edit and test the code with **Jupyter Notebook**.

The second part is written in R markdown, which can be edited and tested by **RStudio**.

All these tools are contained in Anaconda, a data science platform.

In the folder "tutorial", I provide those codes in html and pdf format, which is more friendly to novices.

Besides, in the folder "read_game_log_file", I wrote a script "extract.py" to extract data from logfiles of four games: Gene Labs, Sokoban, London Tower and CTC.

Good luck.
